# Eaton Battery Storage for Home Assistant
Integrate your Eaton xStorage Home (Tiida) to home assistant with the local API.

## Pre-requisite
- A Home Assistant Gateway
- An Eaton xStorage Home (Tiida)
- A local network
- A GitHub account

Please make sure to setup all your devices on the same network.
